# imputeNHANES: impute the data NHANES data

Proposed Steps for Imputing Missing Values in the NHANES Dataset

#### Step 0: Methods Survey 

Evaluate and compare various imputation methods‚Äîsuch as MICE, missForest, autoencoder-based approaches (e.g., denoising autoencoders), GAIN, and diffuse models‚Äîto determine which method(s) may be most suitable for the NHANES data.

#### Step 1: Literature Review & Base Model Construction

Conduct a thorough literature review to identify relevant variables and theoretical relationships within the NHANES dataset. Based on these findings, construct a preliminary or ‚Äúbase model‚Äù that includes the core set of variables essential for accurate imputation.

#### Step 2: Variable Scanning and Selection

Utilize approaches like X-WAS or EnWAS to scan for additional correlated variables across the dataset. From this analysis, select the top 25 variables (or an appropriate number) most strongly associated with the target variable(s) for inclusion in the final imputation model.

#### Step 3: Imputation

Apply the chosen imputation method(s) identified in Step 0. This may involve comparing multiple methods or selecting one method deemed optimal based on performance metrics and the nature of the data.

#### Step 4: Analysis and Scientific Estimation

Perform the final analysis on the imputed dataset and derive the scientific estimand, denoted as  ùëÑ
. Interpret and report results, ensuring that the methodological steps taken to handle missingness are transparent and well-documented.
